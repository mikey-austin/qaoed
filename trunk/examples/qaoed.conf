## qaoed.conf -- qaoed AOE server configuration file
#
# This is an example configuration file with some instructions
# for beginners. Please read the full documentation for a complete
# list of configurable options
#
# The configuration of the aoe server are grouped into sections.
# 1. The global directives sections. This is where global configuration
#    options for the aoe-server are set, for example default-log level.
# 2. The logging section defines the logging targets configurable in 
#    the device and interface sections. 
# 3. The interface section configures values for the different interfaces.
# 4. The default section defines default values for block-devices. Options
#    defined in the default-section can be omited in device configuration.
# 5. Devices, one section for each exported device.
# 6. Access-lists.
#

## Section 1 - global directives 
/* The global directives section sets global options for the qaoed server.
 * Valied options in this section are:
 * log-level       - Sets the logging level of the qaoed server. Possible
 *                   values include: error, info and none. Defaults to error.
 *                   This log-level will be inheritet by sub-sections if no
 *                   other log-level is defined. 
 */                 

log-level         = error; 

## Section 2 - logging directives
/* The logging section specifies logging targets avaiblable in the
 * subsection below. The logging target named "default" will be used 
 * if no other logging option is specified.
 *
 * Valid options are 
 *  name            - Specifies the name used to reference this logging target.
 *  type            - syslog or file. 
 *  syslog-level    - Only applicable of type is syslog, default is LOG_INFO.
 *  syslog-facility - Only applicable of type is syslog, default is LOG_DAEMON.
 *  filename        - Only applicable if type if file, sets the filename
 *                    to write log-data to. Must be writable by the daemon.
 */ 


/* Define the 'default' logging target. This target will be automatically
 * created if it isnt defined in the configuration will. To change the
 * default values used for logging, define a target named "default" and set
 * the appropriate options. This logging target will be used for all
 * interfaces and devices that doesnt have any other logging target explicitly
 * assigned to them. 
 */
 
logging {
	name = "default";
	type = syslog;
	syslog-level = LOG_INFO;

/* Define a file logging target used by the access-lists */

## Section 3 - interface configuration
interface {
	  interface = "eth0";
	  mtu = auto;
	  log = default;
	  log-level = info;
}

interface {
	  interface = "eth1";
      	  mtu = 4096;
}*/

## Section 4 - default device configuration
/* The default section specifies default values used in 
 * device configuration if no value is given. Valid options are:
 *   interface  - Identifies the ethernet device that a device 
 *                is exported on. The default value is eth0 if 
 *                no other value is set.
 *   shelf      - The shelf number, default to zero
 *   slot       - The default starting slot number, if a slot 
 *                number isnt given for a device this value will
 *                be used as a start value and be incremented for 
 *                each new device. 
 *   writecache - Turn on or off write cache, defaults to on
 *   broadcast  - When on, the default value will be to broadcast 
 *                device presence on startup. Defaults to yes unless an 
 *                access-list has been attached to the device.
 *   acl        - a sub-block {} that defines the access-lists to apply 
 *                to the different client operations: read, write, cfgset,
 *                cfgread and discover. See the device section for an example.
 */

{
	shelf      = 33;
	writecache = on;
	broadcast  = on;
      	interface  = eth0;
	log-level  = error;
}

## Section 5 - device configuration
/* The device section specifies all the devices to be exported.
 * Valid options are: 
 *   interface  - Specifies the ethernet interface to export the device on.
 *   shelf      - The shelf number.
 *   slot       - Slot number.
 *   writecache - Turn on or off the write cache. 
 *   broadcast  - To broadcast or not to broadcast, that is the question?
 *   target     - Path to file or blockdevice to export.
 *   acl        - a sub-block {} that defines the access-lists to apply to the
 *                different client operations: read, write, cfgset, cfgread and
 *                discover (discover and cfgread are actually the same). 
 *                You can specify the same or a different access-list for each
 *                operation, but remember that attaching an access-list to the
 *                read and write-operations will impact performance.

## Section 6 - access-list configuration
/* The access-list section specifies all the access-lists. At the end
 * of each access-list there is an implicit reject unless otherwise
 * configured. Valid options are: 
 *  name      - Sets the name of the access-list. 
 *  policy    - Sets the default policy of the list, defaults to reject.
 *  accept    - Add an accept-statement.
 *  reject    - Add an reject-statement.
 *  log       - Enables logging and specifies the logtarget to use. 
 *              A log entry will be created  when a match  is found or 
 *              no match was found and the default-policy was applied.
 *              Warning: If you enable logging on a read/write access-list
 *              it will generate _very_ large logfiles very quickly.
