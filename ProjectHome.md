Qaoed is a multithreaded ATA over Ethernet storage target that is easy to use and yet highly configurable. Without any argument qaoed will try to read the configuration file /etc/qaoed.conf.

NOTE: Most of qaoed's options and behaviour is controlled by the configuration file. Please refer to the man-page of the configuration file as well as the example configuration included in the package for further information on how to use qaoed.
